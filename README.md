College Admission Prediction using Neural Networks
This project involves predicting college admissions using a neural network. The dataset is processed, and a deep learning model is built to predict admission chances based on various input features.

Project Structure
Projects College Admission Prediction.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/college-admission-prediction.git
cd college-admission-prediction
Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the Required Libraries:

Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
Data Processing Steps
Loading the Data:

The dataset clg.csv is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Exploration:

The first few rows of the dataset are displayed using data.head().
Missing values are checked with data.isnull().sum().
Duplicate rows are checked with data.duplicated().sum().
Splitting the Data:

The data is split into features (x) and target variable (y).
Train-test split is performed with train_test_split() from Scikit-learn.
Feature Scaling:

Features are standardized using StandardScaler() to improve model performance.
Model Building
Model Architecture:

A Sequential model is created using TensorFlow's Keras API.
The model has two hidden layers with 64 and 32 neurons, respectively, and ReLU activation functions.
The output layer has a single neuron with a linear activation function for regression.
Model Compilation:

The model is compiled with the sgd optimizer and mean_squared_error loss function, and accuracy is used as a metric.
Model Training:

The model is trained for 50 epochs, and the training history is plotted to visualize loss over time.
Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using the R-squared score (r2_score).
Model Optimization:

The model is recompiled with the adam optimizer, and batch training is used to potentially improve performance.
Results
The model's performance is visualized by plotting the training and validation loss.
The R-squared score is calculated to determine the model's predictive accuracy.
